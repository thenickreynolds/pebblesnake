# Snake for the Pebble watch

This game was for the original Pebble watch built on the initial API. Random is included in source as malloc was unavailable at the time and thus the system random could not be called.

Snake was hacked together in 4 hours on the Facebook campus with beer invovled. The code is OK, the comments are weird.
